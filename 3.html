  <p>Decisions used to be easy, huh?<br>
    What time to get up, what to wear, where to go.<br>
    Now it's a bit different.<br>
    Could you tell friend from foe?<br>
    Could you kill?<br>
    Could you do worse?<br>
    If a loved one was infected, could you do the right thing?<br>
    Could you put your life on the line for me the way I would for you?<br>
    Could you be... the last of us?<br>
